summary: 'A little bit about myself'
---

Hi, thanks for stopping by. Here's a quickie about myself. As of writing this text, I am 20, I grew up in multiple countries
and ended up back in Japan for high school. I currently attend Waseda University for a bachelor's
in Computer Science (although technically its 情報理工学 but the head of department said its a cs equivalent so yeah cs).

That's probably all you need to know if you're a recruiter (or honestly anyone) going through this, but if you're interested in reading more, thank you. Here's a
1000 word essay about my life (i did not count this so please dont attack me if im wrong).

## tech

I always had a thing for technology. I don't know when it started, but I remember breaking my family's desktop after opening it
and tearing the cpu cooler off when I was like 8 years old. Or maybe it was my school, as my primary school required us to get an iPad
to use for school. Anywho, after watching several YouTube videos on building a PC, 10 year old me decided that he was up for the
challenge and spent his whole lifetime savings (probably around 40000 yen) on building a PC. I still remember the specs. It was the
g3258 and a gtx750ti. I honestly think this changed my life. No more was I wasting time on my Wii, I was wasting time on a PC!

I had a few classes here and there on Scratch and Python, but I only started taking programming seriously after I realized
that a CS major isn't going to teach me programming. I honestly felt scammed but here we are haha! Some technologies I use
on a daily basis is TypeScript, React and Next. At the moment, I just really love Vercel and the T3 Stack. Everything becomes
so easy.


## nerd

I am a nerd. A HUGE nerd. I've picked up a few hobbies over my lifetime but one thing that always stuck with me is tinkering.
I can't JUST game on a PC. I have to build it from parts that I handpicked and spend hours and hours trying to install Windows on an empty hard disk.
I can't JUST solve a Rubik's cube. I HAVE to lube it and change magnet strengths so that it's just so I can shave 0.1s off my time. I can't
just play Smash Bros. I HAVE to get mewtwo (my main) in elite smash and grind hours and hours on a niche mewtwo tech that
I might pull off once a month. When I choose to do something, I want to be the best at it. That's just part of who I am.

## speed

Speed is so so so important in this day and age. It seems like most things that I, as a 20 year old, pick up, most people have picked up
when they were 10. If you're around my age and trying to start something new, you are late. I know many people say that you're never
late for anything, but THEY. ARE. LYING. THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT CAN DO EVERYTHING I DID IN THE PAST YEAR, IN A WEEK.

That is why I need to do everything in my power to catch up as fast as possible. I need to work twice as hard, for twice as long to be half as decent
as some people. That's my mentality when it comes to not just coding, but anything that I want to be competitive in. The best have already
started, many many years ago. And if you want to be among the best, you have to put in the work, FAST.

## speciality

I like to specialize. Be it uni entrance exams or smash bros, I have consistently relied on a single 'thing'.
I just naturally happen to do that without realizing, but I think it is one of my strengths. Focusing on one thing at a
time allows for growth that is just not possible when being a generalist. I think one of the reasons I am like this is because
my enthusiasm towards things don't change. I was never interested in literature, and I will probably never be the one raising
my hand in an English class. On the other hand (haha), my interest for Mathematics hasn't diminished ever since my father forced me to remember the multiplication table.
Another 'thing' I happen to like is software. This, this is what I'm going to specialize in.
Oh yeah, I have never eaten anything other than a blt sandwich at subway. So I'm just loyal I guess?

## end.

Well yeah, that's a few things about me, I guess. Now that I think about it, no way was that a 1000 words haha. Maybe I can
write some things that I want to achieve next year since it's December. I want to be rated blue on AtCoder. I want to build a
full stack application that has over 1000 users on it. I want to try out mobile development. And I will do everything in my
power to make sure all of my goals are achieved.

If you're reading this, thank you. Thank you for taking the time out of your day to read about me. I promise you that I
will develop software, that some time in the near future, you and everyone you know will use.

I want to make software that people use.
